The toposheet is for Ahmednagar and Nashik district.
You need to ditize it by identifying various features like roads, village, river, vegetation etc.

Make differnt features like line, point, polygon. Roads and rivers can be line feature, village boundary can be polygon. a house can be point feature.

Later we will do some anlysis on the digitized sheet.

All the best...
